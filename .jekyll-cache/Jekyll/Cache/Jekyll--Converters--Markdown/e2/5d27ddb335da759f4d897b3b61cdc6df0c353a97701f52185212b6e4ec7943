<p><img src="/images/pubpic/past_prj11.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
Bottlenecks exist in generating virtual models from commercial BIM tools and open source gaming engines, which hinder the wide adoption of BIMs use in facilities management phase of civil infrastructure systems. Objective of this project is to identify challenges with converting building information models into virtual models  and enabling component interactions in virtual worlds.<br />
