The NYU Tandon team, NYU E-ROBOT, led by our graduate students: @Dan Lu (CUE PhD at BiLab), @Xuchu Xu (MAE PhD at AI4CE Lab) @Bilal Sher (CUE MS at AI4CE Lab), and advised by Prof. Semiha Ergan and Prof. Chen Feng, has just won a $200,000 cash prize as one of the ten teams out of 69 teams worldwide (i.e., 396 innovators). This cash prize will be awarded to the team soon for developing EASEEBot, a robotic Envelope Assessment System for Energy Efficiency, with a multi-function drone, AI-based data analysis and mapping, and augmented reality for retrofitting. Next year, the team will compete in phase-2 of this competition. More information: https://www.herox.com/EROBOT/update/4126</p>
