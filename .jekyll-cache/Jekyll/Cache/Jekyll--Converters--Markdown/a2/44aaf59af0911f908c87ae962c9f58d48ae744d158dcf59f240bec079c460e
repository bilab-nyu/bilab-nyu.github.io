<p>This research project is about understanding how to improve the efficiency of DR implementation in buildings and how to improve the accuracy of the electricity saving potential estimates of buildings that are participating in DR programs. We are approaching this problem by (1) examining  a large pool of DR protocols in terms of the building information needed in each protocol and look at how building information models can help to streamline access to facility information; (2) automatically extracting synthesized DR related building information from existing BIMs; and (3) estimating the true saving potential of buildings by applying advanced data analysis techniques (e.g., machine learning, deep learning).<br />
