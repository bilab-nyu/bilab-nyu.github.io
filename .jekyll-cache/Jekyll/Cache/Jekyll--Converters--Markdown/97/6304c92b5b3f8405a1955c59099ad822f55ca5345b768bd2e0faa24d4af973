This project aims to identify energy efficiency in buildings and communities at an urban scale. Leveraging publicly accessible datasets, a data-driven approach is employed, utilizing computer vision and spatial analysis techniques. The objective is to provide technical support for energy-saving retrofits in buildings and to achieve urban energy conservation and emission reduction goals. This endeavor contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable urban development and energy conservation. The findings from this research could potentially influence policy-making and urban planning, leading to more energy-efficient and sustainable urban environments.<br />
