<p>The objective of this project is to identify information and visualization requirements of various engineers involved in risk assessment of dams to support their decision making with ease of access to the necessary data and with flexibility in generating views from such data for understanding the dam behavior over time. The project aims at developing an integrated information model that contains such data and enables generation of views for engineers based on the engineering domain you are looking at the risk.<br />
