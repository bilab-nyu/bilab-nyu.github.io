<p>Despite the increased number of safety programs and technologies being implemented during construction times, the number of incidents and accidents is in an incline and a systematic look at the underlying reasons behind incidents/accidents caused by construction operations and a formal way of proactively discovering such causes are needed. This research looks at the impact of construction operations on airport operations during capital improvement projects and utilizes data driven methodologies and information models to identify problems in phasing plans ahead of time.<br />
