Energy Information Visualization‚Äù of the EEB  Hub Project, information architecture and framework for implementing customized dashboards for various stakeholders in the EEB Hub and parties involved in AER projects are being developed. The plan and documentation of the energy related dashboards are being developed for the Building 101 and Building 661 in the Navy Yard. The use cases of the energy related dashboards are being defined, prioritized according to the requirements and implemented in a prototype. This work plan directly contributes to the EEB Hub‚Äôs overall goal which is to decrease energy consumption 20% by 2020 by informing decision makers, occupants and public.<br />
