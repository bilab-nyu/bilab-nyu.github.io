<p>In 2013 alone, more than 20% of the 4000 worker fatalities were in the construction industry with major causes identified as falls, struck by an object, electrocution, and caught- in/between. In addition to fatalities, there are many reported and unreported near misses that occur on a daily basis at construction job sites (OSHA 2015). Such problems can only be eliminated if they are proactively identified as risks, and precautions are taken ahead of time for minimization of accidents/incidents. This funded project aims to proactively identify job related safety issues at construction sites before accidents and near misses occur to help with setting insurance policies.<br />
