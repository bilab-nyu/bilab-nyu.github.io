<p><img src="/images/pubpic/prj3.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
For highly and densely populated cities like New York City, façade inspection is a mandatory routine every 5 years for buildings that have more than 6 floors. The current inspection is mainly based on visual checks, and the results are based on the inspectors’ experience. The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the required information for the decision-making of façade inspection and (2) to support the façade inspection process with a model-based  generation of comprehensive checklists and flexible visualization of inspection findings.<br />
