<p><img src="/images/pubpic/past_prj7.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
HVAC control design intent is primarily transferred through textual narratives called Sequence of Operations (SOOs).  The current guidelines only define how the information may be presented but do not address to the information requirements of the SOOs. A case study analyzed on a 5 story LEED platinum certified commercial building showed that only 21% of the information items were clearly interpreted using the SOOs of an air handling unit (AHU) in that building. This research aims to provide a formalized approach to represent the information requirements of SOOs to enable unambiguous representation of HVAC system controls design intent for better building energy control.<br />
