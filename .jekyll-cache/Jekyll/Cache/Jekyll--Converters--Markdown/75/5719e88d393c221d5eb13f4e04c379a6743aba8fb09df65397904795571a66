<p><img src="/images/pubpic/prj3.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
For high densely populated cities like the New York City, façade inspection is a mandatory routine every 5 years for the buildings that have more than 6 floors. The current inspection are mainly based on visual check and the results are based on the inspectors’ experience. The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the required information for the decision making of façade inspection and (2) support the façade inspection process with an objective way of detecting façade defects using point clouds.<br />
