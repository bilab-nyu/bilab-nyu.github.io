  description: 'Corrective maintenance (CM) has been and will be the predominant maintenance mode in the US in the near future.  Among these indoor air related ones are require prompt attention because people spend about 90% of their time in buildings in the US (EPA, 1989) and such problems directly affect occupants’ productivity and health (Seppänen et al., 2006). However, investigating indoor air related problems is challenging due to the fact that: Information that is needed for troubleshooting of indoor air problems changes as the characteristics of work orders change; Information required during investigation of indoor air problems reside in discrete data sources; and Existing data sources are not efficient to get insights about a problem in a short time. To deal with these industry problems, the objective of my research is to develop a framework which can enable identification, integration and visualization of the information that is critical for troubleshooting of indoor air problems in spaces served by centralized HVAC systems. The proposed research  brings contributions to the existing body of knowledge in the areas of facility maintenance, BIM, and human computer interaction (HCI). The research will enhance the existing body of knowledge in the FM domain by providing structured mechanisms to help HVAC mechanics to identify critical clues for troubleshooting of indoor air problems. The contribution in relation to BIMs will enable expanding information stored in BIMs with explicit representation of HVAC system functional relationships and clues that HVAC mechanics would need for troubleshooting. The research also contributes to HCI domain in terms of the design, evaluation and generation of visualization-based environments for improving the efficiency of HVAC mechanics while investigating indoor air problems.'

  description: '''
  For every construction or renovation project, the general contractor is required to hand over the as-built documents to the owner or the facility management team at the end of the project. The main challenge for the handover process is to ensure the completeness of the captured building information and the accuracy of it in terms of how well it represents the reality. The report published by NIST in 2004 pointed out that $4.8 billion was spent every year just to verify that the captured building information represents accurate building conditions.
  Laser scanning technology is able to capture accurate geometric information in a timely manner. Hence point cloud data captured by laser scans can be used as the reference to update an as-designed BIM into the as-built BIM. However, two challenges were identified in relation to the process of updating an as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM:
  a point cloud is a collection of 3D points without any semantic information (e.g., which building component that a point belongs to), hence it is difficult to recognize and extract building components and their associated geometric information from point clouds; and
  occlusions and construction/renovation progress prevent the laser scanned data captured at a point in time from obtaining a comprehensive view of the building.
  In order to address these challenges, this research resulted in a framework that supports the update of an as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM by incorporating geometric information captured by progressive laser scans. The framework is composed of three main parts:
  identifying different types of features that contribute in recognizing the correspondences between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM;
  evaluating the performance of features for the mapping between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM; and
  leveraging point clouds captured by progressive laser scans to retrieve a complete view of the building and increase the accuracy of the updated BIM.
  This framework removes discrepancies between the design model and the actual building conditions, and provide an accurate (i.e., all the building components and their associated geometric information are captured in the as-built BIM) and complete (i.e., geometric information contained in the as-built BIM reflects actual building conditions) as-built BIM as a part of the as-built handover documents.

  authors: Ergan, S., Radwan, A., Zou, Zhengbo, Tseng, H., and Han, X.
  description: For high densely populated cities like the New York City, façade inspection is a mandatory routine every 5 years for the buildings that have more than 6 floors. The current inspection are mainly based on visual check and the results are based on the inspectors’ experience. The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the required information for the decision making of façade inspection and (2) support the façade inspection process with an objective way of detecting façade defects using point clouds.

  authors: Ergan, S., Radwan, A., Zou, Zhengbo, Tseng, H., and Han, X.
  description: 'This study aims to identify critical parameters of HVAC systems that drive the changes in the building energy-use profiles and develop an automated approach for identifying HVAC operational signatures that result in certain energy profiles in buildings, OperAtional Signature Identification System (OASIS). The OASIS relies on data-driven methodologies and is composed of three major steps: data preprocessing, feature selection, and signature discovery and analysis. The approach was tested on several air handling units (AHUs). The results showed that it is possible to define operational signatures for facility operators that are specific to a given building for running AHUs at these custom settings that correspond to energy efficient consumption in buildings.'

  authors: Ergan, S., Radwan, A., Zou, Zhengbo, Tseng, H., and Han, X.
  description: The impact of built environment on the human responsiveness and performance has long been argued; however, the interrelations between neuroscience and built environment, and the degree to which the built environment contributes to increased human performance and context awareness has not been completely understood yet.  Towards this understanding,this project is at the intersection of Neuroscience and Architecture to quantify the impact of architectural design features on human performance and experience. This project utilizes advanced visualization, virtual reality and body area sensor networks to capture human bodily states while people interact with architectural layouts in virtual settings.
