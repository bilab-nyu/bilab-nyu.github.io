  description: 'Corrective maintenance (CM) has been and will be the predominant maintenance mode in the US in the near future.  Among these indoor air related ones are require prompt attention because people spend about 90% of their time in buildings in the US (EPA, 1989) and such problems directly affect occupants’ productivity and health (Seppänen et al., 2006). However, investigating indoor air related problems is challenging due to the fact that: Information that is needed for troubleshooting of indoor air problems changes as the characteristics of work orders change; Information required during investigation of indoor air problems reside in discrete data sources; and Existing data sources are not efficient to get insights about a problem in a short time. To deal with these industry problems, the objective of my research is to develop a framework which can enable identification, integration and visualization of the information that is critical for troubleshooting of indoor air problems in spaces served by centralized HVAC systems. The proposed research  brings contributions to the existing body of knowledge in the areas of facility maintenance, BIM, and human computer interaction (HCI). The research will enhance the existing body of knowledge in the FM domain by providing structured mechanisms to help HVAC mechanics to identify critical clues for troubleshooting of indoor air problems. The contribution in relation to BIMs will enable expanding information stored in BIMs with explicit representation of HVAC system functional relationships and clues that HVAC mechanics would need for troubleshooting. The research also contributes to HCI domain in terms of the design, evaluation and generation of visualization-based environments for improving the efficiency of HVAC mechanics while investigating indoor air problems.'

  authors: Ergan, S., Radwan, A., Zou, Zhengbo, Tseng, H., and Han, X.
  description: This project aims to quantitatively measure human experience in designed spaces and create responsive virtual environments. It builds of off findings of a recent DARPA project on neuroscience for architecture where requirements for designed spaces for boosting human experience were defined. The responsive environments are generated using labeled emotions of users in biometric sensor data captured while users navigate in virtual spaces.  The three-step approach includes (1) automatically checking BIM of a new design against requirements for enhanced human experience in designed spaces, (2) automatically labeling human experiences on the arousal and valence scale using biometric data captured in distinctly configured virtual spaces, (3) developing reasoning mechanisms to transform spaces based on the streaming BSN data. This research aims to provide the much-needed design guidelines for architects to follow when designing spaces with human experience in mind.

  authors: Ergan, S., Radwan, A., Zou, Zhengbo, Tseng, H., and Han, X.
  description: For high densely populated cities like the New York City, façade inspection is a mandatory routine every 5 years for the buildings that have more than 6 floors. The current inspection are mainly based on visual check and the results are based on the inspectors’ experience. The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the required information for the decision making of façade inspection and (2) support the façade inspection process with an objective way of detecting façade defects using point clouds.

- title: "Customized building operations: Defining operational signatures of HVAC system configurations through data analytics on historical BAS data"
  image: prj3.png
  authors: Ergan, S., Radwan, A., Zou, Zhengbo, Tseng, H., and Han, X.
  description: 'This study aims to identify critical parameters of HVAC systems that drive the changes in the building energy-use profiles and develop an automated approach for identifying HVAC operational signatures that result in certain energy profiles in buildings, OperAtional Signature Identification System (OASIS). The OASIS relies on data-driven methodologies and is composed of three major steps: data preprocessing, feature selection, and signature discovery and analysis. The approach was tested on several air handling units (AHUs). The results showed that it is possible to define operational signatures for facility operators that are specific to a given building for running AHUs at these custom settings that correspond to energy efficient consumption in buildings.'

  authors: Ergan, S., Radwan, A., Zou, Zhengbo, Tseng, H., and Han, X.
  description: The impact of built environment on the human responsiveness and performance has long been argued; however, the interrelations between neuroscience and built environment, and the degree to which the built environment contributes to increased human performance and context awareness has not been completely understood yet.  Towards this understanding,this project is at the intersection of Neuroscience and Architecture to quantify the impact of architectural design features on human performance and experience. This project utilizes advanced visualization, virtual reality and body area sensor networks to capture human bodily states while people interact with architectural layouts in virtual settings.
