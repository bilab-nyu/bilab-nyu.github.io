  # education1: Sheryl worked on developing a formal approach to identify applicable HVAC system components and information requirements that an HVAC mechanic should consider during troubleshooting of indoor air problems, generate the applicable information, and present them to mechanics to better conceive all the clues in relation to the space/system being evaluated.

  # education1: "Te developed a framework that supports the update of an as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM by incorporating geometric information captured by progressive laser scans.<br>
# The framework is composed of three main parts:<br>
  # (1) identifying different types of features that contribute in recognizing the correspondences between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM; <br>
  # (2) evaluating the performance of features for the mapping between a point cloud and an as-designed BIM; and <br>
  # (3) leveraging point clouds captured by progressive laser scans to retrieve a complete view of the building and increase the accuracy of the updated BIM."
